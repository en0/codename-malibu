    # loudness of the audio. This is useful if a particular sound is
    # just too loud everywhere.
    # This field is Optional. Default: 1.0
    gain: 0.75

    # Distance is used to set the maximum distance in game the sound
    # can be heard from.  The volume is scaled down in proportion
    # to the distance from the player using this value as the clip-point
    # This field is Optional. Default: View-Window Height
    distance: 300

    # Category is used to give volume control to the player for different
    # groups of sounds. Think minecraft, hostel mobs or villagers.
